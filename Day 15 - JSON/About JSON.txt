JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. The JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax, but the JSON format is text or string only. JSON is a light weight data format for storing and transporting. JSON is mostly used when data is sent from a server to a client. JSON is an easier-to-use alternative to XML.


Converting JSON to JavaScript Object
Mostly we fetch JSON data from HTTP response or from a file, but we can store the JSON as a string and we can change to Object for sake of demonstration. In JavaScript the keyword JSON has parse() and stringify() methods. When we want to change the JSON to an object we parse the JSON using JSON.parse(). When we want to change the object to JSON we use JSON.stringify().
